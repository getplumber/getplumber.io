## Ambassadors' Responsibilities

_💎 Helping Plumber thrive._

- **Actively promote the brand on social media, blogs, events, etc.**
  - Deliver at least 2 talks or write 2 posts (articles, LinkedIn posts, X

    your experience with a new feature and what more you were expecting).

  - Attend at least 4 feedback sessions (30 minutes each) or webinars to
    which you are invited.
- **Refer new prospects/clients whenever possible.**
  - **Raise awareness** among decision-makers (CISOs, CTOs, Lead DevOps)
    about CI/CD pipeline security and compliance issues.
  - **Consider recommending Plumber** as a solution to these challenges,
    provided it aligns with the context.
  - **Connect** engaged decision-makers ready to solve their security
    challenges with Plumber at least once a year.
- **Support solution implementation in companies.**
  - Implement Plumber at least once a year in a client project (either
    personally or by assisting colleagues) to ensure your perspective and
    feedback are grounded in real-world client experiences.
