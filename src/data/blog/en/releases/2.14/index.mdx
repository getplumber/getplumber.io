# R2Devops 2.14 Release

**We're thrilled to launch R2Devops 2.14, focused on:**

> **✅ Fixing all your CI/CD issues as quickly as possible**

**To make that happen, we've added advanced search, one-click bulk fixes, and one-click bulk merges.**

## 🔍 Advanced Search

Easily find the issues to fix with advanced search in the issues data.

## ⚡ One-Click Bulk Fix

You can now run the automatic issue fixes in bulk. Select issues, click, they're fixed. The dashboard updates live to show progress.

## 🔀 One-Click Bulk Merge

After the creation of merge requests by automatic fixes: merge them with one click.

## ⚙️ Minor Updates

- **Analysis History**: Monitor and review the complete analysis history.
- **CI/CD Missing**: When the GitLab CI/CD configuration is missing, it is now indicated on the `Issues` and `Details > Pipeline Composition` pages.
- **Global Analysis**: The details pages were previously scoped to a specific analysis; that is no longer the case.
- **Improved Composition Chart Performance**: The chart now loads twice as fast.
