The installation is not working as expected ? You're at the right place !

Here are the common errors and how to solve them

## General

Issues related to all installation methods

- **`Redirect URI Invalid` error in GitLab**

  This error occurs when the Redirect URL set for your GitLab application
  doesn't correspond to the `API_URL`. Please, ensure you write the correct
  URL as described in the [section
  OIDC](docker-compose/#-gitlab-oidc).

## Kubernetes

Issues related to installation on Kubernetes using the Helm chart

- **No persistent volumes for chart dependencies PostgreSQL and/or Redis**

  These 3 dependencies requires Persistent Volumes to work. If you haven't a
  default storage class or if you want to use a specific storage class you need to add an option in all of theses values:

      ```yaml
      postgresql:
        [...]
        global:
          storageClass: REPLACE_ME_BY_STORAGE_CLASS
          [...]

      redis:
        [...]
        global:
          storageClass: REPLACE_ME_BY_STORAGE_CLASS
      ```
